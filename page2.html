				<h2> OUR STORY </h2>
				<p> Through history, cafes have been a place to meet friends, work, and provide a source of inspiration.
				I'm a half filipino and half spanish so I decided to formulate menu that merge those things. Our cafe is inspired by fushion of cultures.
				There are also lot of extensive breakfast,lunch and dinner menus with a creative offerings.We also offer events like poetry readings that would make the customer feel more better and comfortable.
				The events in my life inspired me to take plunge and follow my dream. Those events makes me realize that "If you want something, do it now". I decided to name my establishment as CHES CAFE after my second name which is Cheska.
				Some of my menu are inspired by my mother's recipe which she taught me a lot of things in terms of informal training, culinary arts. This past July 2018, we celebrated our first anniversary. </p>
